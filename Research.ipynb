    "1. Bathrooms are noted in floats - what is .25 of a restroom?\n",
    "2. View represents if the house was viewed.\n",
    "3. Is sqftliving15 and sqftlot15 averaged (nearest 15 neighbors)?\n",
    "4. Having latitude and longitude data will alow us to map (good for visuals).\n",
    "5. Need to look into the 'grade' and 'condition'columns a little further - how is the scale determined and how is the grading score calculated?"

    "1 = Poor- Worn out. Repair and overhaul needed on painted surfaces, roofing, plumbing, heating and numerous functional inadequacies. Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction; reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.\n",

    "2 = Fair- Badly worn. Much repair needed. Many items need refinishing or overhauling, deferred maintenance obvious, inadequate building utility and systems all shortening the life expectancy and increasing the effective age.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 = Average- Some evidence of deferred maintenance and normal obsolescence with age in that a few minor repairs are needed, along with some refinishing. All major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy. Effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 = Good- No obvious maintenance required but neither is everything new. Appearance and utility are above the standard and the overall effective age will be lower than the typical property.\n",

    "5= Very Good- All items well maintained, many having been overhauled and repaired as they have shown signs of wear, increasing the life expectancy and lowering the effective age with little deterioration or obsolescence evident with a high degree of utility. \n",
